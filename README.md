Alaris AI

Alaris AI is a health technology platform for early detection and prevention of critical health events. By integrating biosensors with machine learning pipelines, Alaris AI delivers real-time insights and proactive alerts to help individuals and clinicians make informed health decisions before emergencies occur.

Overview

Healthcare today is often reactive. Alaris AI shifts the paradigm by providing a continuous, AI-driven monitoring system that detects risk signals early. The platform is designed to support wearable sensors, process physiological data securely, and generate actionable predictions through a scalable cloud infrastructure.

Features

Multi-Sensor Integration
Compatible with continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), ECG and HR/HRV sensors, skin temperature, EDA, and SpO₂ trackers.

AI-Driven Insights
Machine learning models (logistic regression, anomaly detection, predictive analytics) identify abnormal patterns and forecast potential health risks.

Real-Time Dashboard
Centralized interface for patients and clinicians, with configurable thresholds and historical data visualization.

Proactive Alerts
Early-warning notifications for critical events such as hypoglycemia, arrhythmias, or stress-related instability.

Modular Design
Flexible architecture allowing additional sensors, new algorithms, and third-party integrations.
